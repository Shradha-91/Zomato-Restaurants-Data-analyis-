Zomato Restaurants Data Analysis Project
### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of Zomato restaurant data to uncover patterns in customer behaviour, restaurant performance, and market trends. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can help Zomato, and restaurant owners make data-driven decisions.
### Data Source
The analysis is based on a dataset of Zomato restaurants spanning the years 2010 to 2018. The dataset includes information such as restaurant name, city, country, and other relevant details.
Data Overview
The dataset used in this analysis contains information on various restaurants listed on Zomato. Key variables include:

•	Restaurant Id:  Unique id of the restaurant.
•	Restaurant Name: Name of the restaurant
•	Country Code: Unique Country Id number
•	Online Order Availability: Whether the restaurant accepts online orders (Yes/No).
•	Table Booking: Whether table booking is available (Yes/No).
•	Rating: Customer rating for the restaurant.
•	Votes: Number of votes the restaurant has received.
•	Average Cost for Two People: Estimated cost of dining for two.
•	Date Of Opening: Date of restaurant Opened (Year ,Month, Day).
### Analytical Process
# 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The following steps were taken to conduct the analysis:
1.	Data Extraction: The relevant data fields (city, country) were extracted from the dataset.
2.	Data Cleaning: The data was cleaned to handle inconsistencies in city and country names (e.g., variations in spelling, abbreviations).
3.	Filtering by Year: The dataset was filtered to include only restaurants that were active between 2010 and 2018. This filtering step assumes that the dataset contains information about the years of operation for each restaurant. If the dataset doesn't have this information, we would need to make assumptions based on the available data, such as the date of the first review or listing.
4.	Aggregation: The number of restaurants was aggregated by city and country. This involved grouping the data by city and country and counting the number of restaurants in each group.
5.	Analysis and Visualization: The aggregated data was analyzed to identify the cities and countries with the highest number of restaurants. The results were visualized using tables and potentially charts to illustrate the distribution of restaurants.
# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Descriptive Statistics: Summarized the data to understand its structure and distribution.
•	Correlation Analysis: Analysed relationships between variables to identify key factors influencing customer ratings and votes.
•	Visualization: Used bar charts, line graphs, histograms, and heatmaps to visualize patterns in the data.
# 3. Key Insights and Findings
•	Popular Restaurant Types: Dining restaurants received the highest customer engagement, indicated by the number of votes and ratings.
•	Customer Spending Behaviour: The most common spending range for two people was around 300 rupees, suggesting that mid-range pricing is attractive to customers.
•	Impact of Online Orders on Ratings: Restaurants that offer online ordering tend to have higher ratings, indicating a strong preference among customers for this feature.
•	Rating Distribution: Most restaurants fall within the 3.5 to 4.0 rating range, showing general customer satisfaction but also highlighting areas for potential improvement.
# 4. Conclusion 
•	Average customer ratings are around 3 stars, showing scope for service improvement
•	Price ranges ₹201–500 host the majority of restaurants, highlighting customer affordability preference
•	Only 12% of restaurants offer table bookings and 26% offer online delivery, suggesting limited adoption of digital conveniences.
•	 Restaurants should focus on improving their online ordering systems, as this is positively correlated with higher ratings.
•	Since dining restaurants are the most popular, targeted promotions and offers in this segment could drive further customer engagement.
# Recommendations
•	Boost Online Delivery & Table Booking: Encourage restaurants to adopt online systems to increase convenience and revenue.
•	Focus on High-Growth Cities: Allocate resources to New Delhi, Gurgaon, and Noida while also expanding in underrepresented cities.
•	Enhance Customer Ratings: Implement training & quality checks to improve customer satisfaction and push ratings towards 4–5 stars.
•	Cuisines Strategy: Promote diverse cuisines in regions with limited availability to attract broader audiences.
